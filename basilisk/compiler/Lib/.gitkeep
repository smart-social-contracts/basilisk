This file is here because basilisk/compiler/basilisk_compile_python_stdlib/src main.rs looks for a ../Lib directory. We don't actually run that code inside of the repository, but in the Rust staging area of Basilisk projects, thus to get rid of the rust-analyzer error we are creating this directory.
