 /* Internet Computer determinism patch:
  * Force hash seed to 0 for deterministic execution on the IC.
  * The IC is a replicated state machine that requires all nodes to produce
  * identical results. Python's hash randomization (PYTHONHASHSEED) would
  * cause non-determinism across replicas.
+ *
+ * This patch is applied at compile time via -DPYTHONHASHSEED=0.
+ * Additionally, we disable any runtime sources of non-determinism:
+ * - Random hash seed generation
+ * - Use of /dev/urandom for hash seeding
+ * - getrandom() syscall for hash seeding
+ *
+ * The canister will seed its own RNG via ic_cdk::api::management_canister::main::raw_rand()
